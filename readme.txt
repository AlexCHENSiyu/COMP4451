7. Designer's Remarks
    (a) Most of the name is original in Chinese. Translation loss its original meaning. So actually all weapons or buffs do have their own name.
    (b) We still remain the port to add new Hero, weapon, enemies. (mechanical operation) How to get the image is the problems. 
         All images, music need to be processed by ourselves since they are not open source by Soul Knight.
